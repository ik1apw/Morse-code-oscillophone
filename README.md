# Morse Code Oscillophone – CW Training Tool

**Author:** Emanuele Rossi – IK1APW  
**Status:** ✅ Stable – Built and Tested

## Description
The Morse Code Oscillophone is a **didactic CW audio generator and Morse decoder**
designed for **training, self-learning and CW courses**.

It generates a **pure sinusoidal sidetone**, decodes Morse code in real time
and displays the decoded text on a 16×2 LCD.

The project is based on **Arduino Nano** and a **mechanical Morse key**.

## Main Features
- Pure sinusoidal CW tone (DDS)
- Adjustable frequency (300–1200 Hz, 10 Hz steps)
- Adjustable speed (5–45 WPM)
- Real-time Morse decoder (standard 3:1 timing)
- LCD 16×2 display
- Rotary encoder with push button
- Long press to clear decoded text
